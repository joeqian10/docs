# Before you begin

In the following sections, we will work you through an example of how to release an NEP-5 asset on Neo blockchain, which includes the tasks of setting up and configuring the development environment, compiling, deploying and invoking the smart contract on a private Neo chain.

Neo-CLI will be used to set up a private chain accessible by nodes and Neo-GUI will be used to release smart contracts. Detailed information about the clients can be found in [Neo Node Introduction](../../node/introduction.md).

## System environment

Neo-GUI supports the following environments:

Windows 7 SP1 / Windows 8 / Windows 10

[.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/framework) must be installed for system versions prior to Windows 10.

Neo-CLI supports the following environments:

- Linux (ubuntu 16.04 and above)
- Windows 10

> [!NOTE]
>
> Windows 10 is a recommended choice since Neo-GUI and Neo-CLI will be running at the same time.
>
> This tutorial only describes the occurrences on Windows 10. Readers using other systems may refer to relevant chapters in [Neo Documentation](../../index.md) since environment and dependencies may differ in different systems.
